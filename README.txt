Welcome to the world of HandDrawn! Take a moment to admire the work of an online text-art generator.

…

If you're reading this, you probably have downloaded this game from the correct mirror or alternatively have stollen it, in which case, you have wasted more time than necessary due to the fact that this game is FREE! Anyhow, after installing the game, you should see a folder named "HandDrawn." Inside, you will find the following:

resourcesREADME.txt (<--- Yay! That's me!)modsmain.csHandDrawngamecommon

After launching the game, "console.log" will also appear. If any of these files are missing, an incomplete installation might be the problem. DO NOT move any of these files, rename them, or delete them as it will corrupt the game and generate unhappiness and a game crash. Remember, each version of the game is tested before being sent out so while bugs may exist, stock game crashes are usually not the fault of the maker. Please see "Troubleshooting" for more information.

The following will probably make a lot more sense if you've tried the game before reading this:

HandDrawn has three worlds. The object of the game is to complete each level and approach a Garrison, a special level teaming with baddies. Destroy whatever enemies dwell there and take the Fragmentations (parts of the Chrominator) to further advance towards your goal: restoring color to the land. Along the way, you will collect XP. For whatever reason, the people at the village have a crave for that stuff so make sure to pay them XP to give you cool stuff to aid your adventures! See "The Village" for more information.

Even if you won't find many, there is an option to modify HandDrawn. To install a mod, you will need to place it inside (Mac) Users/(Your Profile)/Library/Application Support/JackRabbit Productions/HandDrawn/Mods or (Windows) C:/Program Files/JackRabbit Productions/HandDrawn/Mods. Modifications can add a new level to the game, provided someone makes one, first. Just place the *.cs file of the add-on of your choice inside "Mods" and when you launch the game, the mod will become active. Otherwise, if there is a problem, you will be directed to the file with the problem. If that file is NOT a mod, and in fact, is internal… uh… SEE TROUBLESHOOTING! (Oh, there it is! vvv)

There will probably be times when you get an error report when the game starts. When you press "OK" the file that has the problem will open. When it prompts you with what application you should open it with, it doesn't really matter because you won't be able to edit the file. Unless it's Main.cs, you won't get too many characters that make sense within the document. The point, however, is the see what exactly is the file of interest. Not a file you installed? Then is an internal error. Remember to check console.log for any other errors that may have occurred. The basic algorithm for solving errors goes as follows:

1. Check the console log. What does it say? Search for "Error" or "Syntax."
2. Are the files with errors
	a) mods? Continue.
	b) things that came with the game? Go to 4.
3. Delete the mod file or find a newer version. Did that
	a) not work? Skip to 4.
	b) work? You're done!
4. Update the game. Did that
	a) work? You're done!
	b) not work? Continue.
5. Do you have
	a) one version of the game that you use? Contine.
	b) two? Skip to 6.
6. Delete the older version of the game. Did that
	a) work? You're done!
	b) not work? Continue.
7. Move the folder (Mac) Users/(Your profile)/Library/Application Support/JackRabbit Productions/HandDrawn or (Windows) C:/Program Files/JackRabbit Productions/HandDrawn to a safe place like the desktop. Did that
	a) work? You're done!
	b) not work? Continue.
8. Launch the game and then check the console again. Are ANY of the errors resolved?
	a) Yes, but only a few. Continue.
	b) No, none at all. Skip to 10.
9. Good! So some of the errors are gone now. Repeat the algorithm and try to root out the other errors. Did that
	a) work? You're done!
	b) not work? Contact support!
10. Dig through everything relating to the game! You'll find the error eventually. Did that
	a) work? YAHOO!
	b) not work? Not even a little bit? Please contact support.
