I sure hope you understand how frustrating the process of growing a carrot is. It's not enough that you have to be extra attentive to it, but 9/10 of the carrots have huge stalks but stubby little orange roots that you actually eat. We are still analyzing the fact that the famed "Bugs Bunny" seems to be able to take multiple bites of the same carrot but only make a limited ammount of progress, therefore, giving him an "infinicarrot." Unfourtunatley, no such evidence that an infinicarrot exists in the real world has been surfaced so you have to buy this one which restores 1.5 hearts to you. Sorry!
