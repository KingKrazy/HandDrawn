A few hundered ago, the apple's reputation was destroyed by some kooky old pedler who poisoned a princess by feeding an enchanted red apple to her (but it really was her fault for being dumb enoguh to trust her). Since then, the polarity on it's deathly effects have been reversed and it is capable of healing anyone who takes a bite by restoring five hearts. Modern science is amazing. Or maybe I just lied and it's poisoned.
