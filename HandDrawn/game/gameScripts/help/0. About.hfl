<bitmap:game/gameScripts/help/JRP><font:Arial Bold:16>About the Developer, JackRabbit Productions: <font:Arial:16>JackRabbit Productions is the independent video game development studio which brought you HandDrawn. Torque 2™ was given to the developer as a Christmas present in 2011 along with the Torque Platform Starter Kit. Since then, the game has been in development. What the developer wanted was a game which really brought drawing to life. Many games before this had plots similar but HandDrawn was to be unique.

<sbreak><font:Arial Bold:16>About HandDrawn:<font:Arial:16> HandDrawn is a Mac and Windows game featuring 'Agent 3,' a Stone Protectors and Deliverers Embassy (or SPADE). <font:Arial Bold:16>The Story:<font:Arial:16> Once upon a time there was a greedy king. He had many riches, but still, he was not satisfied. He wanted the source of ultimate power, the Color Stone. Now this stone was kept safe by the elders in a sanctuary. He came and demanded the stone, lying by saying he was going to move the stone to a safer place, but sensing his lust for power, the wise elders denied him. Blinded with rage he summoned an ancient, dark power known as the Inklings who were locked in the Pyramid of Shadows to do his dirty work. He promised if they did this, he would let them roam free as they once did. They gladly obliged and lay waste to the towns. Finally, they struck down the Elder of the Stone and took the Color Stone for the king. As soon as it was removed from its pedestal, everywhere, except the kings castle lost it's color. He tried to give the land back it's color, but the king only managed to assign the Eight Hues; purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, red white, and black, to the realms. Deciding to just stay in his castle, he let the Inklings take over everywhere but his castle so he would not be faced with the problem. The at the start of the game, we leave off just as the attack is happening…
